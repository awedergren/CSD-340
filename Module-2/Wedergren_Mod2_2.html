<p class="intro"><span class="sentence">My name is Amanda Wedergren.</span>I have lived in Nebraska most of my life and enjoy lots of different hobbies. These include gardening, animals, Nebraska football, swimming, and spending time with my family.
</p>

<p>During the summer, I spend a lot of time swimming and enjoying the outdoors. I really enjoy camping and kayaking as well. These are great family activities too.
</p>

<p>I an working on expanding my current garden space. I am hoping to include a greenhouse. In the greenhouse, I will grow starter plants.
</p>

<p>We recently added ducklings to our homestead. They are 4 days old. They are a lot of fun to watch and my kids really enjoy all of the animals.
